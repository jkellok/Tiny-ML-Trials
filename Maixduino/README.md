## Maixduino
### Installation and documentation

https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maix/maixpy_develop_kit_board/maix_duino.html

#### Arduino
https://maixduino.sipeed.com/en/

#### MaixPy
Use MaixPy with Python files.

https://wiki.sipeed.com/soft/maixpy/en/get_started/install_driver/duino.html

Install USB Driver if needed: https://dl.sipeed.com/MAIX/tools/driver

Update MaixPy Firmware: 
https://wiki.sipeed.com/soft/maixpy/en/get_started/upgrade_maixpy_firmware.html

Download kflash_gui tool: https://github.com/sipeed/kflash_gui/releases

Download firmware and upload to Maixduino with kflash_gui

Firmware used:
- maixpy_v0.6.2_84_g8fcd84a58.bin 
- maixpy_v0.6.2_84_g8fcd84a58_minimum_with_ide_support.bin (use with bigger models)
- maixpy_v0.6.2_84_g8fcd84a58_minimum.bin (no IDE support)

MaixPy IDE: http://www.86x.org/cn-maixpy/cn.maixpy.sipeed.com/en/get_started/maixpyide.html

You can download MaixPy IDE: https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/MAIX/MaixPy/ide/_/v0.2.5

You can also use a serial terminal tool, like putty: http://www.86x.org/cn-maixpy/cn.maixpy.sipeed.com/en/get_started/power_on.html

#### Notes
The camera on the board is GC0328. You may need to download Maixduino_GC0328 library: 	https://github.com/fukuen/Maixduino_GC0328

If you have error with the lcd screen (like in display.ino example code in Arduino) you can remove Adafruit_GFX library from Arduino/libraries folder.

Maixduino SD pin is 29.

Maixduino chip has 6MiB memory, firmware can use up to 2MiB, minimal uses less. Model should be small. When running MaixPy (minimum version), a model of about 4MB can be loaded. If you donâ€™t use the camera and LCD, you can load up to 5MiB of models. When running MaixPy (full version), it can load a model of about 2MiB.

If you want to train a model or download one from [Maixhub](https://maixhub.com), you need Maixduino machine code, you can find instructions there.

## Code
### BlinkExample
A basic Blink example to test the board.

### MaixduinoCamera
Example code to test the camera and the lcd screen.
You need GC0328 library.

### VoiceControlExample
Example code to test voice control. Use get_voice_model.ino first to record your commands. Run the code, open serial monitor, press reset on the board and talk to the microphone. 

You will get number of frames and an array for numbers. Copy these to the voice_model.h. You can press reset again when you want to record another command. In this example, there are four recordings each for "red", "green", "blue" and "turn off". 

Save voice_model.h and run voice_control_led_en.ino to test your voice to change the led color. Each model can have up to four recordings keyed to it and the SpeechRecognizer can have 20 models registered.

### ObjectRecognitionYolo
Example code to test object recognition. For this, klash_gui and MaixPy IDE was used. You could use an SD card instead of klash_gui.

You can follow along this tutorial: https://www.edgemicrotech.com/maixpy-9-maixduino-object-detection-ai-micropython/

YOLOv2 is a pre-trained object detection system: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/

Flash the .kfpkg to Maixduino with kflash_gui to the 0x500000 address. You can use baudrate 115200. Then connect and run the python file.

### FaceDetection
Example code to test face recognition. You can use kflash_gui and MaixPy IDE.

You can follow along this tutorial: https://www.edgemicrotech.com/maixpy-6-maixduino-face-detection-ai-micropython/

Flash the .kfpkg with kflash_gui and run the python file.

Alternatively, you can use Sipeed's own script: https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy_scripts/blob/master/machine_vision/face_find/demo_find_face.py 

### Mobilenet1000Class
A pretrained model that recognises 1000 object was used in Maixduino.

You can follow along this tutorial: https://wiki.sipeed.com/soft/maixpy/en/course/ai/image/1000_type_classifier.html

A minimum firmware was used since the model is big. You can flash or use an SD card. uPyLoader was used to transfer files to board and execute the script. GC heap size needs to be reduced!
