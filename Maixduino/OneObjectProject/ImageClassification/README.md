# Image Classification
You can use the same pictures here of your object but you will need images of another class (another object or just images without the object).

## Steps
1. Gather data
	- Take images of your classes
		- Atleast 50 images of each class, the more the better (I had around 400 of bottle and 400 of no bottle)

2. Preprocess data
	- Resize images for smaller size and rename if you want
	- Split images to training and validation images if you want
		- The split can be done when training too
		- Validation images 10-20% of your training images

3. Training the model
	- a) Train with [Maixhub](https://maixhub.com)
		- You need an account for Maixhub and you can find instruction there
		- Make a new Training project for image classification, create a new dataset and add images and label (limit 50-3000 images)
		- Create Task, Select Model nncase, you can add image augmentation with Mirror, Rotation and Blur
		- Create the Training Task, after training you can check results and Deploy model
		- Download the model manually and unzip
	- b) Train with Tensorflow Keras and convert tflite model to kmodel with nncase
		- Documentation here: https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/
		- Code Examples: Image Classification from Scratch (2-class) and Simple MNIST convnet (multiclass) are good examples to follow
		- Convert the model to tflite and save

			```python
			# Convert to TFLite
			converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
			tflite_model = converter.convert()

			# Save the model
			with open('handmodel_v2.tflite', 'wb') as f:
				f.write(tflite_model)```

		- Convert tflite model to kmodel with nncase
		- You can use Maix_Toolbox: https://github.com/sipeed/Maix_Toolbox
		- Or use https://github.com/kendryte/nncase and follow instructions there (Usage, FAQ, Examples eg. 20classes_yolo)
		- Note limitations: https://github.com/kendryte/nncase/blob/master/docs/FAQ_EN.md
		- Get Maix_Toolbox by git clone
		- Fix bug in Maix_Toolbox (change gz to xz)

			```shell
			nano get_nncase.sh
			â€‹
			//inside the get_nncase.sh
			...
			...
			tar -Jxf ncc-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
			rm ncc-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
			...
			//end of file```

		- Download the library

			```shell
			./get_nncase.sh
			```

		- Put some images in images/ folder for inference, has to be same resolution as input resolution of model
		- Place the model in Maix_Toolbox folder and convert it to .kmodel using

			```shell
			/tflite2kmodel.sh example.tflite
			```

		- I didn't get this working as I got an error

			```shell
			Fatal: Nullable object must have a value.
			```


4. Using the model
	- If you downloaded the model from Maixhub, you also get main.py program to test out your model
	- In main.py, change model_address to 0x300000 if you're not using SD
	- Use kflash_gui to upload minimum firmware (with IDE support) and flash the model to 0x300000
	- Use MaixPy to connect to Maixduino and run main.py

## Issues
- Freezes sometimes, could be a memory issue
- Sometimes get "ValueError: input not support"
