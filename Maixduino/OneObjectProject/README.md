# Object Detection and Image Classification From Scratch

## Prerequisites
- Images of the object
	- for classification, you need images without the object or another object (here: bottle vs no bottle)
	- the more images, the better, but preparing data can take a lot of time
- Image annotation tool for object detection (or use Maixhub)
- Training in Maixhub or with Tensorflow Keras + conversion with nncase
- For Maixduino: minimum firmware (with IDE support)
