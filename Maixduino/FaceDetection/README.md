# FaceDetection
Example code to test face recognition. You can use kflash_gui and MaixPy IDE.

Use kflash.gui to flash firmware (maixpy_v0.6.2_84_g8fcd84a58.bin works) to board if you don't have one already. Flash the .kfpkg with kflash_gui and run the python file.

Alternatively, you can use Sipeed's own script: https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy_scripts/blob/master/machine_vision/face_find/demo_find_face.py
